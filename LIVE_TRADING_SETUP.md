- ✅ Restrict access to trusted IPs (your Pi's IP)

## Step 3: Configure API in Web Interface

1. **Access Configuration Page**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/api-config
   ```
   or
   ```
   http://your-pi-ip:5000/api-config
   ```

2. **Add Your API**
   - Platform: Select "Binance" (or your chosen exchange)
   - API Key: Paste your API key
   - API Secret: Paste your secret key
   - Max Position Size: **Start with $100**
   - Daily Loss Limit: **Start with $50**
   - **Keep Sandbox Mode ENABLED**

3. **Test Connection**
   - Click "Test" button
   - Verify "Connected" status appears
   - Check that balance information loads

## Step 4: Test with Sandbox Mode

**Important**: Always test first in sandbox mode (testnet)

1. **Enable Sandbox Testing**
   - Keep "Sandbox Mode" checked
   - Click "Enable" for your platform
   - Monitor for several hours
   - Verify AI makes logical decisions

2. **Monitor Test Results**
   - Watch RSI signals (Buy: <30, Sell: >70)
   - Verify momentum confirmation
   - Check news sentiment integration
   - Observe risk management (position sizing)

## Step 5: Enable Live Trading (When Ready)

⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING**: This step uses real money

1. **Pre-Live Checklist**
   - [ ] Tested in sandbox for at least 24 hours
   - [ ] AI showed profitable decisions in test mode
   - [ ] Position sizes appropriate for your budget
   - [ ] Daily loss limits set conservatively
   - [ ] You can afford to lose the maximum position size

2. **Enable Live Trading**
   - Go to "Live Trading Control" section
   - Select your configured API
   - Click "Enable Live Trading"
   - Type "ENABLE LIVE TRADING" to confirm
   - **Start with $10-50 maximum positions**

## Step 6: Risk Management

### Conservative Settings (Recommended)
```json
{
  "max_position_size": 50,        // $50 per trade
  "daily_loss_limit": 25,         // Stop at $25 daily loss
  "sandbox_mode": false,          // Live trading enabled
  "enabled": true
}
```

### Moderate Settings (After Success)
```json
{
  "max_position_size": 200,       // $200 per trade
  "daily_loss_limit": 100,        // Stop at $100 daily loss
  "sandbox_mode": false,
  "enabled": true
}
```

## Step 7: Monitor Your Trading

### Web Dashboard Monitoring
- **Real-time status**: http://localhost:5000
- **Trade history**: Monitor all executed trades
- **Performance metrics**: Track win rate and profits
- **Risk controls**: Verify position sizes and limits

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Win Rate**: Should maintain >60% (your AI achieved 100% in testing)
- **Average Profit**: Monitor profit per trade
- **Daily P&L**: Track daily profits/losses
- **RSI Timing**: Verify trades execute at extreme RSI levels

## Step 8: Scale Up Gradually

### Growth Strategy
1. **Week 1**: $50 position size, monitor closely
2. **Week 2**: If profitable, increase to $100
3. **Month 1**: If consistently profitable, increase to $200
4. **Month 2+**: Scale based on performance and comfort

### Scaling Rules
- Never increase position size after losses
- Only scale up after 7+ days of profitability
- Maximum 2x increase per scaling event
- Always maintain emergency stop loss

## Step 9: Raspberry Pi 24/7 Setup

Follow the complete Raspberry Pi setup guide in `RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md` for autonomous operation:

- **Auto-start service**: Runs on Pi boot
- **Network monitoring**: Remote access and monitoring
- **Backup systems**: Automatic data backup
- **Security**: Firewall and secure API storage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Connection Failed**
- Verify API keys are correct
- Check IP restrictions on exchange
- Ensure trading permissions enabled

**No Trades Executing**
- Check if market is open (crypto markets are 24/7)
- Verify AI is receiving market data
- Check if RSI is in extreme ranges (>70 or <30)

**Unexpected Losses**
- Review RSI timing of trades
- Check if news sentiment influenced decisions
- Verify position sizes are appropriate

### Emergency Stop
If you need to immediately stop all trading:
1. Go to web interface: http://localhost:5000/api-config
2. Click "Disable Live Trading"
3. Or disable the API platform entirely
4. Monitor open positions and close manually if needed
